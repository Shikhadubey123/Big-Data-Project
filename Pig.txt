Pig -Grunt shell
Load the Dataset
A = LOAD 'students.txt';  ---Do you thing this will work, no we don't given Location ,but we did't got any  error, A is Kind of Variable because by defalut Pig is kind of Lazy evalution.
dump A; # dump is command which shows output
A = LOAD '/user/dubeyshikha7278907/Pig Data/students.txt';
dump A;
Each line of data as Tuple
In pig we can also attach schema
describe A; schema is unknown,because we do not specify datatype and columns /headers kind of thing
A = LOAD '/user/dubeyshikha7278907/Pig Data/students.txt'As(name,age,gpa);
describe A; # defalut datatype
A = LOAD '/user/dubeyshikha7278907/Pig Data/students.txt'As(name:chararray,age:int,gpa:float);
describe A;
dump A; # In case of Pig is nothing like columns,column headher,schema is attached to every row of data
[1]    FILTER OPERATOR
A = LOAD '/user/dubeyshikha7278907/Pig Data/students.txt'As(name:chararray,age:int,gpa:float);
R = FILTER A BY age>=20;
dump R; # FILTER condition even apply to multiple columns
R = FILTER A BY (age>=20)AND(gpa>3.5);
dump R;

[2]   FOREACH OPERATOR
select * from A
R = foreach A generate*; #* means all columns
dump R;
R = foreach A generate name;
dump R; is used to select column

[3]  GROUP OPERATOR
B = GROUP A  BY age;
dump B; #Grouping key is age ex-which ever tuple we are matching we are getting output..
  
  
[4]  IS NULL/ IS NOT NULL OPERATOR
pig comes with their own language called pig(Latin)
Apache pig is supported by Hadoop
The Actual pig is Data Cleaning, then what is meaning by Cleaning pig can also work on unstructed data and text file...

Apache Hive(SQL Language)
There are two types of table Hive
(1) MANAGED_TABLE - means hive managed your data,bydefalut,Create table
(2) EXTERNAL_TABLE - Create external table ,use can decide where the table will be ie Loctaion..
